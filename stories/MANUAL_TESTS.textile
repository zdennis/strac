h1. Updating Story Points

Story: As a User I want to be able to quickly update the points for a story.
  Scenario: successfully updating the points of a story
    Given there is a project with incomplete stories
    And a user at that project's workspace
    When they click on the points of a story
    And they enter a different point estimate and hit enter
    Then they will see the story points changed
    And they will see a message telling them the story has been updated
